# Vow-of-the-Disciple---Raid-Helper
An application to help navigate the raid and help with succeeding in the individual encounters

In this application I collected information, guides and maps from several reddit threads and condensed everything in this (hopefully) helpful application.

This release contains "only":

- Encounter 1: Acquisition
- Encounter 2: Exhibition
- Encounter 4: Rhulk
- Resonance code (Secret Room) for extra chest after encounter 4
----
- Disciple's Bog and Encounter 2 are currently missing, to due a lack of useful maps/images


# How to use:
## Encounter 1:

The map shows all entrances to the rooms you potentially have to enter, with their corresponding Glyph/Icon above them, as well as the potential spawn locations of the Glyph/Compass - Knights

Click on one of the symbols on the map to open the glyph selection:

After slection your glyp, the door symbol will change to the selected one and it will also appear up top in the header:

Press the reset button to reset all rooms and glyphs, when the next phase starts.

## Encounter 3:

The encounter is separated with each room having its own map.

The map shows:
- the spawn position of the taken knight, that will extend your timer
- the spawn position of the glyp keeper, that will show you 3 glyphs floating in the air
- the possible spawn locations of the overload champions
- the possible spawn locations of the blight spawns


You will have to find the matching glyphs from the glyp keepers, to progress. Since this can get hectig and confusing, the app offers you the possibility to enter and save the matching glyph. Simply click on the highlighted area and select the matching glyph, from the shown selection.
Pressing the reset button will reset the selection of all rooms.

## Encounter 4:

The encounter is simple enough, you only need to memorize 1 matching glyph simbol for each phase. You can, like in encounter 3, simply select the matching glpyh by clicking on the highlighted area.

The map itself is usefull, as it shows you the different potential spawn location, and the (never changing) symbols in the top room.

## Resonance code
This is a "side quest" to for the raid.
At the beginning, before the drop in, an obilisk will spawn, showing different glyphs on it.
Enter all 3 in the highlighted area of the app.

The selection will remain, even if you close the app, and the related description of where to find the hidden rooms will be highlighted
